## Development Etiquette

### Working Branches

When beginning work on a story (i.e. a card from Trello), create a new branch
with the following name format: `<FIRST-INITIAL><SECOND-INITIAL>/<CARD-ID>`  

For example, Luka Manitta working on story 11 would be `lm/11`.  

When work is complete, create a pull request to merge your branch's changes
into the `dev` branch.
